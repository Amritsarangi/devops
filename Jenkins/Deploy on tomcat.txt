Now we have to Deploy our Project On the Tomcat Server

1. After successfull running of project again click on project from dashboard
2. Before that install the deploy container plugin
3. After that go to project configure setting .
4. Come in the bottom to the Post-build action 
5. Click on the add Post-build action and click on Deploy war/ear to container
6. In the WAR/EAR file type **/*.war
   In the context path write nothing
   In the container select Tomcat 9
7. Then in credentials select the credentials
8. And then give the tomcat url with port number
9. And save it
10. Then build the project , if it will siccessfully running then it will be visible
 in the the tomcat manager window.

Also configure tomcat for this because tomcat manager button is not accesible by default so do come
configuration in it

1. firstly go to the apache-tomcat....
2. then go to conf and add following code in the tomcat-users.xml

<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<role rolename="admin-gui"/>
<role rolename="manager-script"/>
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui, admin-gui"/>
<user username="deployer" password="deployer" roles="manager-script"/>
<user username="tomcat" password="s3cret" roles="manager-gui"/>

You have to add this code in the last above to </tomcat-users>

3. Then you have to find the context.xml from tomcat apache directory
   find / -name "context.xml"
4. now you will find that context.xml file is present in the 4 directories
   docs, manager, host-manager , examples . These four files present in the webapp directory. 
5. In these four files you have comment the value line which is present at somewhere at bottom
6. Save these changes and restart the Tomcat

So you have to do these two things to deploy any webapp on the tomcat server
