This to connect the apache servers with two tomcats servers:

1. install two tomcat servers and give different names to them.
2. Do not do ant thing with the first apache server 
3. Go to the second apache server and open the conf file
4. In the conf file there is server.xml file.
5. Edit that server.xml file by vi server.xml
6. Edit the connector port which is 8080 to 8081 or any other port no
7. Also edit the Server port which is <Server port="9005" shutdown="SHUTDOWN"> to 9090
8. Then save and exit from that file
9. Then start both apache servers from apache/bin/./startsh
10.Then install the apache servers by yum install httpd
11.Then go to /etc/http/conf.d
12.There you have to make a file proxy.conf
13.now add that port into this file like:
 
<VirtualHost *:80>

<Proxy balancer://mycluster>
    BalancerMember http://13.233.225.198:8080/
    BalancerMember http://13.233.225.198:8081/
</Proxy>

    ProxyPreserveHost On

    ProxyPass / balancer://mycluster/
    ProxyPassReverse / balancer://mycluster/
</VirtualHost>
save and exit

14. Then restart the httpd server
15. You can also check the port information by writing
    yum insatll net-tools
    netstat -tnpl
16. put the public ip into the URL box now apache will randomly hit any tomcat servers
17. If u get 503 service unavailable error then execute below command:
    /usr/sbin/setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
